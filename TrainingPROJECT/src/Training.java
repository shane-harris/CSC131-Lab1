	 * and commit and push it to the repo. This will all be on the

		/*The next thing that we will practice is creating a merge conflict
		 * and how to resolve the conflict. This will require two people
		 * each time we practice. I will volunteer to be everyones partner
		 * 
		 * A Merge conflict arises when two or more programmers pull from 
		 * the repo. make different changes and both try to commit. the
		 * first to commit will see no issue but the second will need to 
		 * resolve the conflict.
		 * 
		 * I will create a for loop and then the next user will change the
		 * loop to a while loop or do while or whatever you want as long as
		 * its not the same code.
